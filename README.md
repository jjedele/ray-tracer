# The Ray Rracer Challenge

My attempt to follow Jamis Buck's (@jamis) awesome [ray tracer challenge](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge)
in [ScalaJS](https://www.scala-js.org).

## Current State

I finished chapter 2 where I visualized the trajectory of a flying projectile in an environment with gravity and wind.
